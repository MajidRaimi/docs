## GitLab 🦊

GitLab is our go-to platform for code repository management and team collaboration. While many developers might be familiar with GitHub, we've chosen GitLab because it offers enhanced features that better suit our needs, including integrated CI/CD pipelines, advanced project management tools, and a high level of customization.

### Why GitLab Over GitHub? 🤔

While GitHub is a fantastic platform, GitLab provides us with additional flexibility and a more comprehensive suite of tools that help streamline our workflow. Some of the reasons we prefer GitLab include:

- **Integrated CI/CD**: GitLab has built-in CI/CD capabilities that allow us to automate our development, testing, and deployment processes seamlessly.
- **Advanced Project Management**: GitLab offers robust project management features, including issue tracking, boards, and milestones, making it easier for us to manage complex projects.
- **Self-Hosting**: GitLab can be self-hosted, giving us more control over our codebase and security, which is crucial for maintaining our standards.

### Accessing GitLab 🌐

You can access our GitLab instance at [git.wavez.tech](https://git.wavez.tech). This is the central hub for all our code repositories and collaboration tools.

## Docmost üìö

Docmost is our chosen knowledge management and collaboration platform, serving as a robust, open-source alternative to Notion. At Wavez, we use Docmost to organize our documentation, collaborate on project planning, and maintain a centralized knowledge base. Its flexibility and self-hosting capabilities make it an ideal tool for our team.

### Why Docmost Over Notion? ü§î

- **Open Source**: Docmost is open-source, allowing us to customize it according to our specific needs and ensure we have full control over our data.
- **Self-Hosting**: By self-hosting Docmost, we can secure our data within our own infrastructure, enhancing privacy and reducing reliance on third-party services.
- **Feature-Rich**: Docmost offers a comprehensive set of features for documentation, note-taking, project management, and real-time collaboration, all in one platform.

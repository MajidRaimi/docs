## Tools 🛠️

At Wavez, we leverage a suite of powerful tools to develop and design state-of-the-art products. This section of the documentation will guide you through the tools we use, how to set up accounts, and the standards we follow to ensure a secure and efficient workflow. 🚀

## Creating an Account 🧑‍💻

Before diving into the tools, it's important to set up your accounts properly. Here's how you can create an account and the standards we follow for naming and password security.

### Account Creation Guidelines 🔐

1. **Naming Standard**:  
   When setting up an account, please follow these naming conventions for consistency and professionalism:

   - **First Name**: Always use your professional first name. For example, "Majid".
   - **Last Name**: You have the option to use either your family name or your father's name.
     - **Family Name**: Should be formatted as in "Al-Raimi".
     - **Father's Name**: Should be formatted as in "Saleh".

   For example, if your name is Majid Saleh Al-Raimi:

   - You can choose "Majid Al-Raimi" or "Majid Saleh" as your display name.
   - This helps maintain a professional and uniform identity across all tools.

2. **Password Security**:  
   Security is a priority at Wavez. When creating passwords for any of our tools:

   - Use at least **12 characters**.
   - Include a mix of **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **special characters**.
   - Avoid using easily guessable information like names, birthdays, or common words.
   - Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** if the tool supports it. 🔐

3. **Password Management**:  
   Use a secure password manager to store and manage your passwords. This will help you generate strong passwords and avoid reusing them across different tools.

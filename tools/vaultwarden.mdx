## Vaultwarden 🔐

Vaultwarden is an open-source password manager we use at Wavez to securely store and manage all our passwords. A password manager like Vaultwarden helps you generate, store, and retrieve complex passwords for various accounts without the need to remember each one individually. This ensures that your passwords are strong, unique, and protected.

### What is a Password Manager? 🗝️

A password manager is a tool that securely stores your login credentials for different websites and services. Here are some key benefits:

- **Secure Storage**: Password managers encrypt your passwords, keeping them safe from unauthorized access.
- **Convenience**: You only need to remember one master password to access all your stored credentials.
- **Stronger Security**: It allows you to use complex and unique passwords for each account without the hassle of remembering them.

### Important: Master Password 🚨

Your Vaultwarden account is secured by a master password. **If you lose this password, we cannot restore it for you.** Vaultwarden uses strong encryption, which means only you have access to your stored data. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a master password that is both strong and memorable. We recommend storing this master password in a secure location, such as a trusted password manager or a secure physical backup.

## Affine üß©

Affine is our unique, experimental tool at Wavez, bringing together the best of both worlds from tools like FigJam and Notion. Imagine if FigJam's interactive brainstorming and Notion's powerful organization had a kid‚Äîthat would be Affine. It's an open-source platform designed to support creative collaboration, ideation, and organization, all in one flexible workspace.

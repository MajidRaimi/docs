## Penpot 🎨

Penpot is our new *experimental* design tool at Wavez, serving as an open-source alternative to Figma. While Figma is a well-established design platform, Penpot offers us the opportunity to explore a more flexible and self-hosted solution tailored to our unique needs. As we continue to experiment with Penpot, we're evaluating its capabilities to see how it can enhance our design workflow.

### Why Penpot Over Figma? 🤔

Penpot is open-source and self-hosted, giving us more control over our design assets and data privacy. Although it may not have all the features that Figma offers at the moment, its open-source nature allows for rapid development and customization to fit our needs. By experimenting with Penpot, we're exploring new possibilities for a more integrated design experience within our infrastructure.

### Accessing Penpot 🌐

You can access our Penpot instance at [penpot.wavez.tech](https://penpot.wavez.tech). This is where we're conducting our experimental testing to see how well Penpot integrates into our design process.

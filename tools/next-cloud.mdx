## Nextcloud ☁️

Nextcloud is our dedicated platform for file sharing and management at Wavez. Unlike traditional cloud storage solutions like Google Drive, Nextcloud offers us complete control over our data with enhanced privacy and security features. By self-hosting Nextcloud on our own infrastructure, we ensure that our files are managed efficiently and securely in one centralized location.

### Why Nextcloud Over Google Drive? 🤔

While Google Drive is a widely used platform, Nextcloud offers several key advantages that align with our team’s needs:

- **Data Privacy**: Nextcloud is self-hosted, meaning all our data is stored on our own servers. This gives us full control over our files and ensures that sensitive information remains private.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Nextcloud provides robust collaboration tools, allowing team members to share, edit, and manage files in real-time without sacrificing security.
- **Customizability**: Being an open-source platform, Nextcloud can be tailored to fit our specific workflows and requirements, offering more flexibility than traditional cloud storage solutions.

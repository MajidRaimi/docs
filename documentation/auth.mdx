## Credentials 🔑

As a part of Team Wavez, you will be provided with your own official email address. This email follows the format:

**`name@wavez.tech`**

For example, if your name is Majid Al-Raimi, your email address would be: **`majid@wavez.tech`**.

## Email Forwarding Policy 📧

We use an email forwarding policy to streamline communication. This means you don't need a separate, real email account for Wavez. Every time you use your Wavez email address for anything related to the Wavez working environment, the emails will automatically be forwarded to the personal email you provided us with when you joined the team. 📨

### What This Means for You 💼

- You can use your Wavez email for all internal communications, project-related inquiries, and official correspondence.
- No need to manage another email inbox; everything is redirected to your personal email.
- Please ensure that you check your personal email regularly to stay up-to-date with all team communications.

## Facing Issues? ❗
